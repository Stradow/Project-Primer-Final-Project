Severance
Introduction
Severance is a psychological thriller series by Apple TV+ that explores the ethical and existential dilemmas of a surgical procedure called "Severance," which separates a person's work memories (Innie) from their personal life memories (Outie). The company, Lumon Industries, markets this as a way to achieve "work-life balance”. 
Concept
Lumon Industries Careers Website (Severance Procedure Promotion).  We are Lumon Industries and advertise working at our company, with a webpage which reflects our company identity.
Theme
Theme: A sleek, corporate, and slightly eerie promotional website for Lumon Industries, advertising the benefits of the Severance procedure to potential employees. The site should feel like authentic corporate propaganda—clean, persuasive, and subtly unsettling.
Key Pages & Features (wireframe from Garrett)
Header – Logo and Navbar
Hero section: A smiling employee (Innie) in Lumon’s sterile office, tagline: “Severance: A New Era of Work-Life Harmony”. (Some catchy line)

Testimonials from "happy" employees (vague, corporate-speak: "I leave my stress at the door.”).

Short video/animation of the Severance chip implant (glowing, futuristic).

"The Severance Procedure" – How It Works (Awesome app features) Infographic-style breakdown:
Step 1: "Quick, painless brain surgery.”
Step 2: "Your Innie thrives at work; your Outie lives free."
Step 3: "Seamless transition—no memory overlap."

Fake scientific endorsements ("98% employee satisfaction!").

"Life at Lumon" – Corporate Utopia

Photos of the minimalist, cult-like office (MDR, Perpetuity Wing).

Perks: "Waffle parties! Music Dance Experience! No outside worries!"

Ominously vague: "Your Outie will thank you."

"Join Us" – Apply Now

A sterile form with invasive questions (e.g., "Do you believe in the work?").

Legal disclaimers in fine print ("Lumon is not responsible for unintended psychological effects.").

Easter Eggs / Hidden Dark Tone

Glitches in animations (brief flickers of distressed employees).

Cryptic messages in source code/comments (e.g., "Help us. They’re watching.").

Design & Tone:
Visuals: Clean, corporate, retro-futuristic (Lumon’s 70s-inspired aesthetic).

Color Palette: Whites, muted blues/greens, Lumon’s signature pale tones.

Typography: Sans-serif (corporate), occasional eerie distorted text.

Micro-interactions: Buttons that feel too satisfying (like Lumon’s manipulative rewards).
